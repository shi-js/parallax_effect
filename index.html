Born in New Zealand and raised in Australia, Rosé signed with South Korean label YG Entertainment following a successful audition in 2012 and trained for four years before debuting as a member of the girl group Blackpink in August 2016.

      In March 2021, Rosé made her solo debut with her single album R. The album sold 448,089 copies in its first week, the highest for a Korean female soloist. Lead single "On the Ground" was also a commercial success, topping the Billboard Global 200 and peaking in the top five domestically.</p>
